I chose Takawo's p5 sketch for this assignment.

I am interested in how Takawo's sketches can be different each time I refreshed it, and how multiple sketches can be fit into one page.

I referenced p5 reference page and also some other online information to finish the annotations.

One thing that I think is very smart is that Takawo uses external color palette so that he doesn't need to deal with color for each element, which is very convenient.
